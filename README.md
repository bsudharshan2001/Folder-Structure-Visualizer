This Python script provides a simple graphical tool to visualize the structure of a selected folder, including all its subfolders and files. It presents the folder structure in a tree-like format, making it easy to understand the hierarchy of your files and directories.

## Features

- User-friendly GUI for folder selection
- Recursive traversal of folder structure
- Tree-like visualization of folders and files
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the `folder_structure_visualizer.py` file.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Run the script using Python:

   ```
   python get_folder_structure.py
   ```

2. A file dialog will open, allowing you to select the folder you want to visualize.

3. After selecting a folder, a new window will appear displaying the folder structure in a tree-like format.

## Output Format

The script displays the folder structure in the following format:

```
- Root_Folder
    |-File1.txt
